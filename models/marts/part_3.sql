-- ==========================================
-- PART 3: Monthly Load Placeholders
-- This file shows the SQL you might run inside Airflow tasks or manually.
-- Replace {{YM}} with a value like '2020-05' (or pass via dbt/Airflow variables)
-- ==========================================

-- EXAMPLE 1: Load a month's raw CSV (already merged in your case, so optional)
-- \copy bronze."listings_raw" FROM '/path/to/listings_{{YM}}.csv' CSV HEADER;

-- EXAMPLE 2: (Bronze â†’ Silver) Upsert for the month's slice from bronze to silver
-- Here we assume bronze.listings_raw exists and contains a YEAR_MONTH column.
-- (If you loaded directly to silver via pandas, you can skip this.)

-- Create a temp typed view for the month:
